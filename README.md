In April 2020 we reported on motorists travelling at more than double the speed limit during lockdown, as Department for Transport data showed motor vehicle use in Great Britain had fallen by two thirds over the past month, particularly since the UK went into lockdown on 23 March. Additional reporting was done by The Local Democracy Reporting Service.
